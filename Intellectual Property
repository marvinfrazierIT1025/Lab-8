WIPO was developed to help governments, businesses and society realize the benefits of Itellectual Property.

 copyright protection is obtained automatically without the need for registration or other formalities.
 
 Registration makes the copyright owner eligible for statutory damages, attorney fees, and costs of suit.
 
 It could be prudent to copy right the image i created because it is intelectual property that I created and would protect it from people using it as their own.
